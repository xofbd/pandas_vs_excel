    "# Pandas and Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet software, containing data in tabular form. Entries of the data are located in cells, with numbered rows and letter labeled columns. Excel is wide spread across industries and has been around for over thirty years. It is often people's first introduction to data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most users feel at home using a GUI to operate Excel and no programming is necessary for the most commonly used features. The data is presented right in front of the user and it is easy to scroll around through the spreadsheet. Making plots from the data only involves highlighting cells in the spreadsheet and clicking a few buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various short comings with Excel. It is closed source and not free. There are free open-source alternatives like OpenOffice and LibreOffice suites, but there might be compatibility issues between file formats, especially for complex spreadsheets. Excel becomes unstable for files reaching 500 MB, being unresponsiveness and crashing for large files, hindering productivity. Collaborations can become difficult because it is hard to inspect the spreadsheet and understand how certain values are calculated/populated. It is difficult to understand the user's thought process and work flow for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functionality of the spreadsheet is sensitive to the layout and moving entries around can have disastrous effects. Tasks like data cleaning, munging, treating different data types, and handling missing data often are difficult and require manual manipulation. Further, the user is limited to the built-in functionality of the program. In short, Excel is great for certain tasks but becomes unwieldy and inefficient as the tasks become more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python library pandas is a great alternative to Excel, providing much of the same functionality and more. Pandas is great for data manipulation, cleaning, analysis, and exploration. Additionally, these tasks can be easily automated and reapplied to different datasets. It is built on top of the NumPy Python library which offers fast and efficient numerical computations. Unlike Excel, it is open-source and free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people may be intimidated to use Python and pandas because they will have to move away from the point-and-click GUI approach of Excel. Knowing pandas is a great introduction to more powerful and complex data analysis. This article explores how do to some common Excel tasks in pandas, helping people get their feet wet with one of the most powerful Python libraries for data science."

    "The equivalent to an Excel spreadsheet in pandas is the `DataFrame` class. It looks like a spreadsheet, with rows, columns, and indices. For this article, we will exam a case of three spreadsheets, with the first two containing information on a student's exam score for a particular exam and the final spreadsheet has information on which section the students belongs. These `DataFrames` are loaded into memory from CSV using the `read_csv` function."

Pivot tables can also be used to filter out rows from a table. In pandas, we can easily filter out rows from our `DatFrame` by using Boolean logic. For this example, we would like to determine the student's name that belong to section \"A\". This is done in pandas by first creating an array of True/False values. This array corresponds to which rows met the condition. We then use the resulting Boolean array to only call rows that meet our condition."
